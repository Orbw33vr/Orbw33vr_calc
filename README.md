//Hello, This is another one of my projects where I explore more of the capabilities of Vanilla Js, React, and Tailwind CSS to create a page full of different calculators.

Some of the calculators are mostly just conversion calculators that I will update frequently to showcase my ability to pull live information from current exchange rates for different countries of money and calculate(convert) the user entered amount $$ into the other countries amount.

Other Calculators will include some static formulas  that convert lbs to kg or BMI and even dog years to human years.
